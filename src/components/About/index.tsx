            <p>I am a former French teacher turned full-stack developer. As someone who has always been drawn to the creative and artistic, I have found programming to be the perfect outlet for my unique perspective and problem-solving skills.</p>
            <p>My journey into the world of tech began when I discovered my passion for designing and building projects. The more I learned, the more fascinated I became with the endless possibilities of coding. From crafting intuitive user interfaces to optimizing backend functionality, I relish the opportunity to build innovative and efficient solutions.</p>
            <p>As a former teacher, I bring a collaborative approach to my work, always striving to understand the needs and goals of my clients and team members. Whether I'm building a custom web application or optimizing existing code, I am committed to delivering quality results that exceed expectations.</p>
